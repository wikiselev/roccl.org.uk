Our parish was founded in <b>1973</b> by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_of_Sourozh">Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh</a>. We celebrate Great Vespers or Vigil each Saturday at 17:00 and the Divine Liturgy each Sunday at 10:00. Services are also celebrated on the great feasts of the Orthodox Church.

<h3>The Parish</h3>

We are an international Orthodox Parish. The services in the parish are, for the most part in English. Our parishioners come from Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus with others, mainly converts, from the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Zimbabwe, Australia, Hong Kong, South Africa and the USA. Each year several University students become part of the parish during their studies in Cambridge. From the 30 people who worshipped at the Divine Liturgy in 2001, on most Sundays we now have some 120 people, about 20% being under the age of eight!
